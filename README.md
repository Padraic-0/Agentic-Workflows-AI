# Multi-Agent AI Tutor for Psychology Students

This repository hosts experimentation files aimed at exploring the use of **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to implement a multi-agent-based AI tutor tailored for psychology students. The project is a hands-on approach to learning and experimenting with cutting-edge AI technologies to create educational tools.

## üìö **Purpose**

The primary objective of this repository is to:

1. **Experiment with LangChain and LangGraph:** Understand how these frameworks can be used to create and manage multi-agent systems for educational purposes.
2. **Develop AI-Driven Learning Tools:** Design a prototype AI tutor capable of interacting with psychology students, providing insights, answering queries, and facilitating an engaging learning experience.
3. **Enhance Understanding of AI in Education:** Test workflows and frameworks that integrate AI into psychology education to better understand their potential and limitations.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications with LLMs through composability.
- **LangGraph**: A tool for structuring and visualizing relationships between multiple agents in an AI system.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for experimentation and implementation.
- **Multi-Agent Architectures**: Leveraging agent-based models to simulate interactive and dynamic tutoring scenarios.
